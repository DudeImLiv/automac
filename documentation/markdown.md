# Getting Started with Markdown

- [Getting Started with Markdown](#getting-started-with-markdown)

Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text. It's commonly used on Github for READMEs and Github Docs. Most of the writing you'll find in the developing community is written and maintained using Markdown. It's the easiest way to convert to and from HTML and publish online. And it's incredibly easy to write in using your IDE (Like, highlighting a word or phrase to wrap in brackets, parenthesis, quotations, etc.? Think of *that* in conjunction with the multi-line cursor feature? *Swoon* — formatting in Markdown has never been easier.)

Here are a couple of resources to get started:

- How To Geek's [Markdown Introduction](https://www.howtogeek.com/448323/what-is-markdown-and-how-do-you-use-it/#what-is-markdown) and my personal favorite, shd101wyy's [Markdown Basics](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/markdown-basics) nestled into the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension documentation.
- Github's [Syntax & Formatting Basics](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- Daring Fireball's [Basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and [Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

You can find documentation on using Markdown all over the internet and can export a wide variety of content simply by understanding how easily HTML converts to Markdown. See [Quick Actions](quick-actions.md/#md-to-txt) for a simple TXT to MD conversion script, as well as the [Export Markdown](../configuration/scripts/export-markdown.md) browser script — they are *\*chefs kiss\**.

Don't forget the [extensions](vscode-ext.md/#functional) for writing and viewing Markdown files, cause we *work smarter, not harder*, remember?
