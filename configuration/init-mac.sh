# init-mac.sh

# usage: this installs iterm2 and launches iterm2,
# which will then run the full install script (mac-config.sh)

# important note: you must right-click on the file after you have saved it, & select Get Info. in the Get Info window, you will see 'Where' followed by the path to the file... you can right-click this, copy it and use that as the prefix to your file path. you will use this method often when needing a specific file path. REMINDER: this path does not include the file name, you will have to append the file name to the path.

# this has been adapted into a Quick Action script that can be run from the Finder, the script is called... 'get-path.sh'.
